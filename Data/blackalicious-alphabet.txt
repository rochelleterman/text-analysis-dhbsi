Artificial amateurs, aren't at all amazing.
Analytically, I assault, animate things.
Broken barriers bounded by the bomb beat.
Buildings are broken, basically I'm bombarding.
Casually create catastrophes, casualties.
Canceling cats got their canopies collapsing.
Detonate a dime of dank daily doing dough.
Demonstrations, Don Dada on the down low.
Eating other editors with each and every energetic.
Epileptic episode, elevated etiquette.
Furious fat fabulous fantastic.
Flurries of funk felt feeding the fanatics.
Gift got great global goods gone glorious.
Getting godly in his game with the goriest.
Hit em high, hella height, historical.
Hey holocaust hints hear 'em holler at your homeboy.
Imitators idolize, I intimidate.
In an instant, I'll rise in an irate state.
Juiced on my jams like jheri curls jocking joints.
Justly, it's just me, writing my journals.
Kindly I'm kindling all kinds of kink on.
Karate kick type brits in my kingdom.
Let me live a long life, lyrically lessons is.
Learned lame louses just lose to my livery.
My mind makes marvelous moves, masses.
Marvel and move, many mock what I've mastered.
Niggas nap knowing I'm nice naturally.
Knack, never lack, make noise nationally.
Operation, opposition, off not optional.
Out of sight, out of mind, wide beaming opticals.
Perfected poem, powerful punch lines.
Pummeling petty powder puffs in my prime.
Quite quaint quotes keep quiet it's Quantum.
Quarrelers ain't got a quarter of what we got uh.
Really raw raps, rising up rapidly.
Riding the rushing radioactivity.
Super scientifical sound search sought.
Silencing super fire saps that are soft.
Tales ten times talented, too tough.
Take that, challengers, get a tune up.
Universal, unique untouched.
Unadulterated, the raw uncut.
Verb vice lord victorious valid.
Violate vibes that are vain make em vanished.
While I'm all well what a wise wordsmith just.
Weaving up words, weeded up on my work shift.
Xerox, my X-radiation holes extra large.
X-height letters, and xylophone tones.
Yellow back, yak mouth, young ones yaws.
Yesterday's lawn yard sell our yawn.
Zig zag zombies, zoom in to the zenith.
Zero in zen thoughts, overzealous rhyme ZEALOTS!....
